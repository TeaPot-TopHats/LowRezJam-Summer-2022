# Descrtiption 
An infected spacecraft floats along the cosmos and Operator Magnus is being sent to contain the threat. The Amogii have been observed to spread like a cancer throughout space and without proper decontamination, there will be no end to them. Command believes one man and a flamethrower are all that's necessary for the task, so head out there Magnus and smoke out from every vent the malicious Amogii.

The game does not have a large goal set up at the moment. The game ends either when the player dies or the player decides to kill the final boss. Both of which are rather easy to do. Enemies will keep spawning throughout the game so always be aware and stay on the move. Controls are WASD for movements and the mouse will aim the flame thrower. Left click to let the flames roar. However, the flames can only stay on for a bit and have to "recharge" essentially. The time to run and refill are rather short however. 

We might expand upon this in the future, at the moment our team has just been trying to get into the groove of making games and for the first time our submission isn't late. So we like to think we're making progress.

Regarding the music and sound effects. Sound effects were grabbed from https://quicksounds.com. Music was originally intended to be created by another member of the team, but due to scheduling concerns he was not able to complete his pieces in time. So we used these two songs instead:

And yes, it's all just an Amogus meme.
